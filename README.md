## ABSTRACT

Management of scholarships is a crucial component of higher education institutions as it entails coordinating student financial aid. Institutions require assistance in efficiently managing their scholarship programs due to the rising number of scholarship applications and the difficulty of the application procedure. This research paper offers a case study of how using an online platform for managing scholarships might improve scholarship management.

The study involved a qualitative approach, including interviews with scholarship staff, administrators, and students and reviewing existing scholarship management systems. The findings show that implementing an online scholarship management system can improve scholarship management processes' efficiency, accuracy, and transparency. The system provides a centralized platform for managing scholarship applications, enabling real-time updates, and reducing the manual workload of scholarship staff, and administrators. Furthermore, the system enhances communication and collaboration among scholarship staff, administrators, coordinators, and applicants.

The study recommends that institutions adopt online platform scholarship management systems to enhance their scholarship management processes. The findings provide insights into the benefits and challenges of implementing such procedures and highlight the importance of effective communication and training for successful adoption.
Overall, the study offers an expanding body of research on applying technology to improve higher education administration and provides institutions looking to strengthen their scholarship management procedures with valuable recommendations.
